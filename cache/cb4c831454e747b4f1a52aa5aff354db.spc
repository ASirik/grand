BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Thursday, May 3, 2012 -- Defective by Design will hold its annual International Day Against DRM on Friday, May 4th, targeting the use of Digital Restrictions Management on ebooks. Several other organizations have joined to express their concern for the freedoms of authors and readers, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Creative Commons, O'Reilly Media, No Starch Press, the Accessible Computing Foundation, Libre Graphics Magazine, Fight for the Future, Angry Robot Books, APRIL, the Free Software Foundation and its sister organizations, FSF France, FSF India and FSF Europe.<p>Matt Lee, campaigns manager of Defective by Design, said, "DRM is a growing problem in the area of ebooks, where people have had their books restricted so they can't freely loan, re-sell or donate them, read them without being tracked, or move them to a new device without re-purchasing all of them. They've even had their ebooks deleted by companies without their permission."</p>
<p>As part of the day, people fed up with DRM are holding protest and awareness events in Cincinnati, Orlando, Amherst, San Francisco, Boston, Madrid, Rome, Manchester, Nagoya (Japan), and Aveiro (Portugal). More events are still being added at <a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012">http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012</a>.</p>
<p>Supporters are also taking action online, displaying the campaign's banner and using the opportunity to blog about their frustrations with DRM.</p>
<p>Notable science fiction author and editor of the influential BoingBoing.net blog, Cory Doctorow said, "As an author, I understand that DRM doesn't do squat to protect my interests. As a businessperson, I understand that DRM usurps my commercial relationships with my customers and hands them to DRM vendors."</p>
<p>Sanders Kleinfeld, author of <i>HTML5 for publishers</i> said in an interview with O'Reilly Media, "What's disappointing right now is that Amazon is very set on their Mobi format for their Kindle device, Apple has made strides away from EPUB 3 with their latest iBooks 2.0 and iBooks Author. I think vendors that make these devices are interested in maintaining that lock-in for customers."</p>
<p>Defective by Design has held previous international days against DRM in 2006, 2010 and 2011, focusing on use of DRM by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and the RIAA. Defective by Design is a campaign of the Free Software Foundation.</p>

If you browse the Web today, your browser will probably download and run nonfree JavaScript software on your behalf.  You should be able to say no to that software—but to date, that hasn't been practical.  JavaScript License Web Labels are our newest effort to make this easier.<p>In 2009, Richard Stallman published <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">&ldquo;The JavaScript Trap.&rdquo;</a>  It observed that JavaScript served from the Web is now often significant software&mdash;and if it's nonfree, it causes all the same problems for users as any other proprietary software.  Anybody who's serious about protecting their freedom should reject nonfree JavaScript, just like you'd reject traditional proprietary desktop software.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this has been easier said than done so far.  Browsers will typically download and run JavaScript without the user's knowledge.  People who want to avoid running nonfree JavaScript have had little recourse to date besides disabling JavaScript entirely&mdash;but that's throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/javascript-labels.html">JavaScript License Web Labels</a>.  This is a format that we propose webmasters use to publish license information and source code for the JavaScript they deploy on their sites.  It looks simple enough to be accessible to any visitor, but provides enough detail that automated tools can confirm that all of a site's JavaScript is actually free.  Such software will make it practical for people to run free JavaScript and refuse nonfree code.  Tools like this are already being developed: <a href="http://lduros.net/librejs/">LibreJS</a> is a plug-in for Mozilla-based browsers that will support JavaScript License Web Labels.</p>

<p>Webmasters should find a lot to like in JavaScript License Web Labels, too.  We believe that webmasters that correctly publish JavaScript License Web Labels will comply with conditions in the GNU GPL and AGPL to accompany object code with a copy of the license terms and a way for recipients to get source code.  The format is flexible enough that any interested webmaster should be able to use it: it doesn't require them to serve the JavaScript files any specific way, or coordinate with upstream JavaScript developers.</p>

<p>We hope these labels will empower users to be as selective about what licenses they'll accept for JavaScript as they are for traditional desktop software.  That said, this is an early effort to tackle the problem, and we're happy to consider changes that can make it more attractive to webmasters or their visitors.  For details about the decision-making process behind JavaScript License Web Labels, and how you can send feedback to us, please read our accompanying <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/javascript-labels-rationale.html">rationale document</a>.  We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

Well, you did it! We raised $300,000 for free software during our winter fundraising drive, thanks to your contributions.<p>Even better, we also exceeded our "behind the scenes" goal, which was
to sign up at least 400 new members over the two months. I'm really
thrilled to welcome so many new supporters, including our 423 new
associate members.</p>

<p>On behalf of everyone here at the FSF, I'd like to thank all of you
who donated and joined, and all of you who helped promote the effort
through your networks. The amount of response this year was incredibly
gratifying, and makes me feel extremely optimistic about what we can
get done in the year ahead.</p>

<p>I'd specifically like to thank Mark Holmquist, who referred 15 of
those 423 new members all by himself, our intern emeritus Danny
Piccirillo who went above and beyond in getting the word out, Max and the gang from
reddit, and everyone who donated $500 or more to appear on our
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/thankgnus">ThankGNU list</a>.</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun writing the <a href="/appeal/2011/learn-more-about-who-we-are-and-what-we-do">fundraiser pieces</a> this
year describing the work of the different staff members here at the
FSF, and how we could get more done in each area with increased
financial support. We didn't get a chance to write about everyone yet
(like, ahem, me!), but we'll pick up where we left off next time.
Thank you to all of you who wrote to us with encouraging comments
about this series of articles &mdash; of course we always worry about
annoying our supporters by being too pushy, so it was very good to
hear that the articles were worthwhile reading.</p>

<p>Now that you've given us a vote of confidence to do more for you, it's
time for us to get to it!</p>

<p>You can keep tabs on our work by signing up for our monthly <a href="/fss">Free
Software Supporter newsletter</a> (along with occasional interim
updates), and subscribing to our <a href="/blogs/RSS">blogs RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to see all of you in person at
<a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet2012">LibrePlanet</a> this March in Boston! And for
anyone who will be at FOSDEM this weekend, <a href="/events/is-copyleft-being-framed">look me

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA — Monday, January 30, 2012 — The GNU Project today announced the relaunch of its worldwide volunteer-led effort to bring free software to educational institutions of all
levels. <p>The new effort is based at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/education">http://www.gnu.org/education</a>.</p>

<p>The newly formed GNU Education Team is being led by Dora Scilipoti, an
Italian free software activist and teacher. Under her leadership, the
Team has developed a list of specific goals to guide their work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Present cases of educational institutions around the world who are
successfully using and teaching free software.</p></li>
<li><p>Show examples of how free programs are being used by educational
institutions to improve the learning and teaching processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish articles on the various aspects involved in the use of
free software by educational institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain a dialogue with teachers, students and administrators of
educational institutions to listen to their difficulties and
provide support.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in contact with other groups around the world committed to
the promotion of free software in education.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>GNU and its host organization, the Free Software Foundation (FSF),
emphasize that free software principles are a prerequisite for any
educational environment that uses computers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Educational institutions of all levels should use and teach free
software because it is the only software that allows them to
accomplish their essential missions: to disseminate human knowledge
and to prepare students to be good members of their community. The
source code and the methods of free software are part of human
knowledge. On the contrary, proprietary software is secret,
restricted knowledge, which is the opposite of the mission of
educational institutions. Free software supports education,
proprietary software forbids education.</p>

Scilipoti adds insights about the project's organizing philosophy,
current contributors, and progress so far. Of her basic motivation for
being involved, she says, "As a free software advocate and a teacher,
I always felt that the GNU Project needed to address the subject
specifically and in depth, for it is in the education field that its
ethical principles find the most fertile ground for achieving the goal
of building a better society."</p>

<p>In her article, Scilipoti also highlights some of the free software
success stories from around the world, especially Kerala, India, where
the government has migrated over 2,600 of its public schools to free
software.</p>

<p>While the Education Team has already compiled a collection of useful
materials, they are also looking for more volunteer contributors.
People who want to help, or who have information about instructive
examples of existing use of free software in schools, should contact
<a href="mailto:education@gnu.org">e&#100;&#x75;&#x63;&#97;&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#110;&#64;g&#110;&#x75;&#x2E;&#x6F;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

<p>"Education really is one of the most fundamental areas we need to
focus on to achieve real social change," said Free Software Foundation
executive director John Sullivan. "We need to be acknowledging and
assisting schools that are doing the right thing, and helping those
who aren't yet on board understand why those giveaway Microsoft
Office, iPad, and Kindle deals aren't so great for classrooms after
all. We're very thankful to all of the Team members for stepping up to
meet this challenge. I hope others will be inspired by their work and
join the effort."</p>

<p>The Education Team has also been working closely with GNU's
Translation Team to make the new materials available in as many
languages as possible. People interested in helping with the
translation component of the project should see the information at

<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and
redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and
use of free (as in freedom) software &mdash; particularly the GNU operating
system and its GNU/Linux variants &mdash; and free documentation for free
software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and
political issues of freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites,
located at fsf.org and gnu.org, are an important source of information
about GNU/Linux. Donations to support the FSF's work can be made at
<a href="http://donate.fsf.org">http://donate.fsf.org</a>. Its headquarters are in Boston, MA, USA.</p>

<h3>About Free Software and Open Source</h3>

<p>The free software movement's goal is freedom for computer users. Some,
especially corporations, advocate a different viewpoint, known as
"open source," which cites only practical goals such as making
software powerful and reliable, focuses on development models, and
avoids discussion of ethics and freedom. These two viewpoints are
different at the deepest level. For more explanation, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html</a>.</p>

<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>

<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>

<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a>.</p>

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA — Monday, October 17, 2011 — The Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a statement open for public signing, titled "Stand up for your freedom to install free software." <p>The statement, published at
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement</a>,
is a response to Microsoft's announcement that if computer makers wish
to distribute machines with the Windows 8 compatibility logo, they
must implement a system called "Secure Boot." The FSF statement warns
against the danger that, if done wrong, this system would have to be
called Restricted Boot, because it could make computers incapable of
running anything but Windows.</p>

<p>The technology in question aims to protect against malware by
preventing unauthorized operating systems components from booting.
Stopping unauthorized tampering could be a feature, says the FSF, but
only so long as it doesn't prevent users from intentionally running
and modifying free software. If the boot system works in this fashion,
then it deserves the name many are already calling it, "Secure Boot."</p>

<p>However, the FSF is concerned that Microsoft and hardware
manufacturers will implement the system in a way that will prevent
users from booting anything other than Windows. In this case, the FSF
offers the more accurate name of Restricted Boot, explaining that such
a requirement would be a severe restriction on computer users and, by
giving only a remote third party control over what's authorized to run
on their computers, not a security feature at all.</p>

<p>"We're looking at a world in which it could become impossible for the
average user to install GNU/Linux on any new computer, so too much is
at stake for us to wait and see if computer manufacturers will do the
right thing. Secure Boot could all too easily become a euphemism
for restriction and control by computer makers and Microsoft &mdash;
freedom and security necessitate users being in charge of their own
computers," said FSF executive director, John Sullivan.</p>

<p>Those signing the FSF's statement urge all computer makers
implementing this system to resist any pressure to adopt Restricted
Boot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, the undersigned, urge all computer makers implementing UEFI's
so-called "Secure Boot" to do it in a way that allows free software
operating systems to be installed. To respect user freedom and truly
protect user security, manufacturers must either allow computer
owners to disable the boot restrictions, or provide a sure-fire way
for them to install and run a free software operating system of
their choice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signers of the statement commit to "neither purchase nor recommend
computers that strip users of this critical freedom," and to
"actively urge people in our communities to avoid such jailed
systems."</p>

<p>"I have been astounded by the number of people reaching out to us from
all over the world, asking us to help build awareness and put pressure
on computer manufacturers," said FSF campaigns manager, Joshua Gay. He
added that "some of the people who contacted us expressed their
nightmarish scenario of having even more hardware being tossed in
landfills as a result of this," referring to the popular trend of
reviving older hardware with GNU/Linux &mdash; something that would no
longer be possible if more computers were locked by design into only
running Windows.</p>

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Thursday, September 29, 2011 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the re-launch of its Free Software Directory at directory.fsf.org. The Directory lists over 6,500 programs that are free for any computer user to download, run, and share. It was first launched nearly a decade ago, but the new version brings a host of new features designed to make it a more useful and current resource for users, developers, advocates, and researchers. 
<p>"Since its inception, the Directory has been one of our most popular
and important resources. Its careful curation has made it a reliable
place to find applications for any purpose that are free &mdash; as in
freedom &mdash; for everyone. Users can find programs they need, and
advocates can find programs to recommend. But with so much free
software being written and shared now, we wanted to update the
technology we use for the site so that contributors can participate in
examining and posting new entries, and users can more easily search
them," said John Sullivan, FSF's executive director.</p>

<p>Because each entry is individually checked and tested, users know that
any program they come across in the Directory will be

<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> with free
documentation and without proprietary software requirements. Programs
that run on proprietary operating systems like Mac and Windows are
listed, but only if they also run fully on GNU/Linux. The new version
of the Directory will continue to provide users these same assurances,
but it has been rebuilt so that members of the free software community
can become familiar with the criteria and then work together to curate
and grow the catalog.</p>

<p>The new site is based on MediaWiki, free software most famously
known for powering Wikipedia. It also uses a set of extensions called
Semantic MediaWiki that add advanced search and presentation
capabilities, structured to be useful for reading by both humans and
data-mining programs. </p>

<p>"We're empowering contributors to improve every aspect of the site, from
its look and feel to enabling more types of information and
multimedia to be associated with each individual listing," states
campaigns manager, Joshua Gay, who adds that "we also have plans to
collaborate around sharing data with GNU/Linux distributions and other free
software projects."</p>

<p>To most users of the Directory, the key aspect of the new software is that it will make it
easier for them to find the program they need. An extensive and flexible category system, plus
over 40,000 keywords and more than 40
different fields of information, enhance both simple and advanced searching.</p>

<p>Yaron Koren, one of the free software developers behind Semantic
MediaWiki, gave support and help in the re-launch effort. "I
created the Semantic Forms extension in order to allow for sites that
combine the collaborative nature of a wiki with the structure and
queryability of a database; so it's heartening to see Semantic
MediaWiki and Semantic Forms being used for that purpose, and so
comprehensively, in the Free Software Directory," he said.</p>

Distributors lose their rights when they violate GPLv2, but the Free
  Software Foundation is more forgiving in its license enforcement to
  encourage continued participation in the free software community.
  GPLv3 has improved termination provisions to codify this approach,
  giving developers one more reason to upgrade.<p>Thanks to Android's commercial success, the kernel Linux, which is
released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, is
being distributed more than ever before.  Whenever someone distributes
GPL-covered software, they must follow a few conditions set forth in
the license.  These conditions try to give anyone who receives the
software both the legal permission and the practical tools necessary
to change and share the software themselves if they wish.</p>

<p>Not all of the companies that distribute Android heed these
conditions.  We've witnessed an uptick in GPL violation
reports&mdash;some convincing, others incomplete or
misinformed&mdash;against these vendors.  We generally can't pursue
these violations directly, because only copyright holders can enforce
free software licenses in most countries, and few Android devices use
FSF-copyrighted code.  However, people still seek out our opinions
about the relevant parts of the GPL, and that discussion has recently
turned to GPLv2's termination provisions.  Section 4 of the license
says, &ldquo;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we enforce the license of FSF-copyrighted software, we give
violators back the rights they had after they come into compliance.
In our experience, developers of Linux are happy to do the same.
Unfortunately, even if we assume they all would restore these rights,
it would be extremely difficult to have them all formally do so; there
are simply too many copyright holders involved, some of whom haven't
worked on the project in years or even decades.</p>

<p>When we wrote GPLv2 in 1991, we didn't imagine that a free software
project might have hundreds of copyright holders, making it so
difficult to get a violator's rights restored.  We want it to be easy
for a former violator to know that they're still allowed to change and
share the software; if they stop distribution because of legal
uncertainty, fewer people will have free software in the long run.
Hence, we created new <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section8">termination provisions for GPLv3</a>.  These
terms offer violators a simple method to earn back the rights they
had.  Parties who violate the license have their rights restored
provisionally as soon as they come back into compliance, and
permanently if no copyright holders terminate those rights within
sixty days of the last violation.  Furthermore, first-time violators
will have their rights restored permanently if they come into
compliance within thirty days of receiving such notice.</p>

<p>GPLv3's approach has several advantages over GPLv2's.  By having the
license grant forgiveness by default, instead of terminating rights
permanently, it better matches our community's expectations and normal
compliance strategy.  It will be easier for violators to get their
rights restored by any copyright holders who do terminate rights,
because the notice will establish a clear way for the violator to get
in touch.  Finally, GPLv3's termination provisions don't sacrifice
anything we need: the license's conditions still do their best to
protect software freedom, and copyright holders will still be able to
legally enforce the license against parties that don't comply.</p>

<p>This is just one of many reasons
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">why GPLv3 is better than GPLv2</a>.  This change has already
given some companies the reassuring nudge they needed to start
distributing GPL-covered software, and we expect to see more of that
in the future.  When we give distributors a chance to rejoin the free
software community and fix any mistakes they might make&mdash;in stark
contrast to most proprietary software licenses&mdash;we get both
compliance and more allies.  GPLv3 improves on earlier versions of the
license by codifying that enforcement strategy.  For this reason and
others, we urge developers who are releasing projects under GPLv2 to
upgrade to GPLv3.  Companies that sell products that use Android can
help out by encouraging the developers of Linux to make the switch to

When OpenOffice.org moves to a non-copyleft license, there's a ready
  replacement for people who want a productivity suite that does more
  to protect their freedom: LibreOffice.<p>Oracle, IBM, and the Apache Software Foundation jointly announced last
week that OpenOffice.org would become an official Apache project.
OpenOffice.org is an important piece of free software, and many of its
supporters suggest that this change will give them more control over
the project's future direction.  However, users and contributors
should be aware that, as part of this transition, it will become
easier for proprietary software developers to distribute
OpenOffice.org as nonfree software.</p>

<p>All Apache projects are distributed under the terms of the Apache
License.  This is a non-copyleft free software license; anybody who
receives the software can distribute it to others under nonfree terms.
Such a licensing strategy represents a significant policy change for
OpenOffice.org.  Previously, the software was distributed under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  The LGPL is a
weak copyleft license, so programs that merely link to the software
can be released under nonfree terms, but the software covered by the
LGPL must always be released, along with its source code, under the
LGPL's terms.  Free software developers are clearly comfortable with a
partial copyleft when it's appropriate; in numerous surveys of free
software projects, the LGPL is commonly listed as the second-most
popular license (after the GNU General Public License), or else
follows close behind.</p>

<p>While we do
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html">recommend the Apache License in specific situations</a>, we do
not believe it is the best choice for software like OpenOffice.org.
This situation calls for copyleft, because the gains free software
stands to make from a non-copyleft license don't justify giving a
handout to proprietary software developers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's a ready alternative for people who want to work
with a productivity suite that does more to protect their freedom:
LibreOffice.  Anybody who's comfortable with OpenOffice.org will find
a familiar interface and feature set in LibreOffice, because it was
originally based on the same source code.  Since September 2010,
numerous contributors have been working to improve the software, and
the project's legal steward, The Document Foundation, is committed to
keeping it licensed under the LGPL.</p>

<p>LibreOffice's commitment to user freedom does not end at the license
of its source code. Like OpenOffice.org, the software's built-in
extension manager makes it easy to add new features, but unlike
OpenOffice.org, its <a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List">extension database</a> only lists
<a href="/news/fsf-launches-free-software-extension-listing-for-openoffice.org">add-ons that are under a free license</a>. OpenOffice.org
points to a database that includes proprietary extensions, and doesn't
always provide clear licensing information.  This approach to extensions risks turning free
software into a platform for the development and promotion of proprietary
extras.</p>

<p>Anybody who plans to use or contribute to one of these productivity
suites should understand how these policies affect them, and consider
which better complement their own goals. While both pass the most
important test of being free software, we recommend LibreOffice
because its policies do significantly more to promote the cause of
free software.</p>

part of the launch, the FSF is also offering copies of each book
signed by the author at <a href="http://shop.fsf.org/category/signed/">http://shop.fsf.org/category/signed/</a>.</p> 

<img src="http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faas-news.png" alt="Free Software, Free Society" class="imgright" />
 
<p>The new edition of <em>Free Software, Free Society</em> features a number of
improvements: it has both new essays and updated versions of classic
pieces on the GNU Project and free software. Part of the book is
devoted to the issue of language framing and its significance in the
survival of free software; another discusses the traps that erode
computer-user freedoms, and a third urges software users to choose
civic values and community over convenience. This edition also adds an
index, and a new introduction by FSF licensing compliance engineer
Brett Smith.</p> 
 
<p>Also now in print is GNU Press's second edition of <em>Free as in
Freedom</em>, Sam Williams's biography of Richard Stallman, revised and
annotated by Stallman. Williams released the first edition of the book
under the GNU Free Documentation License, thus encouraging others to
modify and improve upon the work. While the second edition is actually
a new joint work, it follows in this original spirit. "I have aimed,"
writes Stallman, "to make this edition combine the advantages of my
knowledge and Williams's interviews and outside viewpoint." Stallman
preserves all of Williams's relevant quotes and most of his personal
impressions, and contrasts them with his own.</p> 

<img src="http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-news.png" alt="Free as in Freedom" class="imgright" />
 
<p>These books will be available electronically as PDFs but will notably
<em>not</em> be distributed in the Amazon Kindle format or for any other
proprietary ebook reading platform, because of the Digital
Restrictions Management (DRM) those systems impose on users. "This
malicious device," says Stallman, "is designed to attack the
traditional freedoms of readers: There's the freedom to acquire a book
anonymously, paying cash &mdash; impossible with the Kindle for all
well-known recent books. There's the freedom to give, lend, or sell a
book to anyone you wish &mdash; blocked by DRM and unjust licenses. Then
there's the freedom to keep a book &mdash; denied by a back door for remote
deletion of books."</p> 
 
<p>Proceeds from the sale of these books will help fund the FSF's
campaigns to defend and promote computer users' rights &mdash; including
its work against DRM via the <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org">DefectiveByDesign.org</a> campaign.</p>

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, March 22nd, 2011 -- Free
Software Foundation president Richard M. Stallman announced the
winners of the FSF's annual free software awards at a ceremony on
Saturday, March 19th, held during the LibrePlanet 2011 conference at
Bunker Hill Community College.<p>Two awards were given: the Award for the Advancement of Free Software,
and the Award for Projects of Social Benefit.</p> 
 
<p>The Award for the Advancement of Free Software is given annually to an
individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and
development of free software, through activities that accord with the
spirit of free software.</p> 
 
<p>This year, it was given to Rob Savoye. Savoye is a long-time free
software hacker, who has worked on GNU and other free software for
over 20 years. He has contributed to dozens of projects including GCC,
GDB, DejaGnu, Newlib, Libgloss, Cygwin, eCos, Expect, multiple major
GNU/Linux distributions, and One Laptop Per Child. Savoye has led the
effort to produce a free software Flash player, <a href="http://www.gnashdev.org">Gnash</a>. This work
has enabled free software users to avoid dependency on a pervasive
piece of proprietary software. Rob is also CTO and founder of Open
Media Now, a nonprofit dedicated to producing a freely licensed media
infrastructure.</p> 
 
<p>Savoye joins a distinguished list of previous winners:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>2009 John Gilmore</li> 
<li>2008 Wietse Venema</li> 
<li>2007 Harald Welte</li> 
<li>2006 Ted Ts'o</li> 
<li>2005 Andrew Tridgell</li> 
<li>2004 Theo de Raadt</li> 
<li>2003 Alan Cox</li> 
<li>2002 Lawrence Lessig</li> 
<li>2001 Guido van Rossum</li> 
<li>2000 Brian Paul</li> 
<li>1999 Miguel de Icaza</li> 
<li>1998 Larry Wall</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The Award for Projects of Social Benefit recognizes a project that
intentionally and significantly benefits society through collaboration
to accomplish an important social task.</p> 
 
<p>This year, the award went to the <a href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a>. Using free software, Tor
has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world to experience
freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in
control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal
in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt.</p> 
 
<p>Tor Project executive director Andrew Lewman was present to accept the
award on the project's behalf.</p> 
 
<p>Tor joins an impressive list of previous winners:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>2009 Internet Archive</li> 
<li>2008 Creative Commons</li> 
<li>2007 Groklaw</li> 
<li>2006 Sahana Disaster Management System</li> 
<li>2005 Wikipedia</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Stallman and the awards committee also gave special acknowledgment to
the work of Adrian Hands, who passed away on February 3rd of this
year. Adrian suffered from ALS, and was unable to use a keyboard --
but using a Morse code device and deep dedication, he spent some of
the last days of his life writing <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78514#c19">code to improve the usability of
GNOME for himself and others.</a></p> 
 
<p>This year's award committee was: Suresh Ramasubramanian, Peter H.
Salus, Wietse Venema, Raj Mathur, Hong Feng, Andrew Tridgell, Jonas
Oberg, Vernor Vinge, Richard Stallman, Fernanda G. Weiden and Harald
Welte.</p>

software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and
political issues of freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites,
located at fsf.org and gnu.org, are an important source of information
about GNU/Linux. Donations to support the FSF's work can be made at
